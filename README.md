## Team Number 39 - MY VOTE APP

### Project Overview

* We know that in the present scenario in-person voting has become quiet cumbersome and tedious. 
  Still people are trying to figure out ways for polling with heightened security etc.
  But these methods raise major saftey concerns in such trying times.

* My Vote is an android app which allows you to conduct elections according to your convenience
  whether it be a College Council election or Departmental election etc. 

### Solution Description

* My Vote app has interfaces for both the admin and the voters. The admin needs to log in to their account 
for conduction of the polls i.e.,mention the available posts and the respective candidates. Also he/she will
decide when the voting lines get enabled/disabled.

* Voters need to login to their account in order to cast their vote. On the basis of the data provided different 
polls are created for the different posts. Once a voter submits the votes they are supposed to logout as one person 
gets only vote for any available post.

* Results of the voting can be checked with the "Results" button. After the voting lines are disabled no voter is 
allowed to vote and thus the results at the time would be final.
